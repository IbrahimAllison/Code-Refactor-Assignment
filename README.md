# Code Refactor Starter Code
I got the starter code from: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram
This is my Module 1 Assignment for the Boot Camp
I changed the Height of Social Media Marketing Box in Line 158 of the CSS Code from 300px to 367px to align with the benefits class (long Vertical box by the right of the Web page). At 300px, the Social Media Marketing box did not align correctly with the benefits class box. See attached screen shot 1. <img width="928" alt="Screenshot 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116689797/235422867-3e4d70de-0136-4dd3-be9b-d4cb9ab12460.PNG">
